## Description

This project tasked the developer with creating nosql database models and RESTful routes to support functionality of a pre built front end. Beyond gaining practical experience with Mongoose and mongoDB, this project taught me to conciser the design of an application's interface when choosing and setting up a database.

## Technologies

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Installation

to use this project as a basis for further development, clone this repo and open it in a Node.js runtime environment and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies. Create a mongoDB Atlas cluster. Delete the .EXAMPLE form the included .env.EXAMPLE file and update with the connection string for the mongoDB Atlas cluster. The command `npm start` will start the server on port 3103.
